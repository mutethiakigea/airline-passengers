Airport Analytics: Passenger Behavior and Hotel Insights
Overview
This project focuses on analyzing passenger behavior within airports and understanding the relationship between airport traffic and hotels situated nearby. Leveraging SAS for analytics and SQL for querying databases, the project aims to derive insights into passenger demographics, travel patterns, and hotel preferences within airport vicinities.

Objective
The main objectives of this project include:

Analyzing passenger demographics, travel behavior, and patterns within airport premises.
Investigating the correlation between passenger behavior and hotel accommodations nearby.
Providing actionable insights for airport management and hotel operators to optimize services.
Tools Used
SAS: Utilized for analytics, exploratory data analysis, passenger segmentation, and predictive modeling.
SQL: Employed for querying databases containing passenger and hotel-related data.
Project Structure
1. Data Collection
Sources: Airport databases, airline records, hotel booking systems, and public datasets.
Data sets: Passenger information, travel itineraries, hotel-related data within airport premises.
2. Data Cleaning and Integration
Ensuring data consistency, accuracy, and completeness.
Handling missing values, formatting issues, and inconsistencies.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Uncovering patterns, trends, and distributions in passenger demographics and travel behavior.
Exploring correlations between passenger behavior and hotel accommodations.
4. Passenger Segmentation
Utilizing SAS analytics to segment passengers based on various criteria.
5. Hotel Analysis
Using SQL queries to investigate hotel-related data and its correlation with passenger behavior.
6. Predictive Modeling (Optional)
Developing predictive models using SAS to forecast future passenger trends and hotel demands.
7. Visualization and Reporting
Creating visualizations and reports using SAS tools to present key findings and actionable insights.
Deliverables
A comprehensive report detailing insights into passenger behavior and hotel preferences.
Visual representations of key findings (charts, graphs, etc.).
SQL queries and SAS scripts are used for analysis and modeling.
Recommendations for airport management and hotel operators.
